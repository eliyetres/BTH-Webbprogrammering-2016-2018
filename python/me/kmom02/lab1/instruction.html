<h1>Lab 1 - python</h1>
<p>If you need to peek at examples or just want to know more, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python manual</a>.</p>

<p>There you will find everything this lab will go through and much more.</p>


<h2>1. Integers, strings, floats and basic arithmetics</h2>
<p>The foundation of numbers and basic arithmetic.</p>


<h3>Exercise 1.1</h3>
<p>Create a variable called &#8216;numOne&#8217; and give it the value 50. Create another variable called &#8216;numTwo&#8217; and give it the value 76. Create a third variable called &#8216;result&#8217; and assign to it the sum of the first two variables.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2</h3>
<p>Create a variable called &#8216;numThree&#8217; and give it the value 91.</p>

<p>Create another variable called &#8216;numFour&#8217; and give it the value 92.</p>

<p>Subtract &#8216;numThree&#8217; from &#8216;numFour&#8217; and answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.3</h3>
<p>Find out the product of &#8216;numOne&#8217; and &#8216;numThree&#8217; and answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4</h3>
<p>Divide 30 with 5 and answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.5</h3>
<p>Create a variable called &#8216;floatOne&#8217; and give it the value 56.69.</p>

<p>Create another variable called &#8216;floatTwo&#8217; and give it the value 55.02.</p>

<p>Sum the two values and answer with the result, rounded to 2 decimals.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.6</h3>
<p>Subtract &#8216;floatTwo&#8217; from &#8216;floatOne&#8217; and answer with the result. Round to 2 decimals.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.7</h3>
<p>Answer with the product of &#8216;floatOne&#8217; and &#8216;floatTwo&#8217;, rounded to 4 decimals.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.8</h3>
<p>Create three variables: &#8216;n1&#8217; = 177, &#8216;n2&#8217; = 339 and &#8216;n3&#8217; = 100. Sum up &#8216;n1&#8217; and &#8216;n2&#8217;. Subtract &#8216;n3&#8217; and answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.9</h3>
<p>Answer with the result of 402 modulo (%) 61.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.10</h3>
<p>Add the word: &#8216;device&#8217; to the word: &#8216;beach&#8217; and answer with the result.</p>







<h2>2. Conditions, exceptions, booleans, if, else and elif</h2>



<h3>Exercise 2.1</h3>
<p>Answer with the boolean value of: 376 is less than 482.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.2</h3>
<p>Answer with the boolean value of: 195 is larger than 129.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.3</h3>
<p>Answer with the boolean value of: 376 == 195.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.4</h3>
<p>Create three variables representing dice values: &#8216;d1&#8217; = 5, &#8216;d2&#8217; = 5 and &#8216;d3&#8217; = 2. Sum them up and answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.5</h3>
<p>Create an if statement to see if the total value of your dices is 11 or higher. If that is the case, answer with the string: &#8216;big&#8217;, else answer with the string: &#8216;nothing&#8217;.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.6</h3>
<p>Create an elif statement that checks your total dice value. The checks and results should be: three of the same value = &#8216;triple&#8217;, total of 11 or higher = &#8216;big&#8217;, total of 10 or lower = &#8216;small&#8217;. If you get a triple you should not make more checks.</p>







<h2>3. Built-in functions</h2>
<p>Some useful built-in functions.</p>


<h3>Exercise 3.1</h3>
<p>Use <code>max()</code> to find the largest number in the serie: 6,8,95,2,12,152,4,78,621,45.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.2</h3>
<p>Use <code>min()</code> to find the smallest number in the serie: 6,8,95,2,12,152,4,78,621,45.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.3</h3>
<p>Use <code>len()</code> to find the number of letters in the word: syntax.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.4</h3>
<p>Convert the number 590 to a string and add it to the word &#8216;syntax&#8217;. Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.5</h3>
<p>Convert the number 119.67 to an integer and then to a string. Add it to the beginning of the word: &#8216;syntax&#8217;. Answer with the result.</p>







<h2>4. Functions</h2>
<p>Basic functions.</p>


<h3>Exercise 4.1</h3>
<p>Create a function called &#8216;prodNr&#8217; that takes two arguments, 83 and 64. The function should return the product of the numbers.</p>

<p>Answer with a call to the function.</p>






<h3>Exercise 4.2</h3>
<p>Create a function called &#8216;funnyWord&#8217; that takes one argument and adds it to the string &#8217; is a funny word&#8217;. If the argument is &#8216;water&#8217;, the function should return: &#8216;water is a funny word&#8217;.</p>

<p>Use the argument &#8216;resort&#8217; and answer with a call to the function.</p>






<h3>Exercise 4.3</h3>
<p>Create a function called &#8216;inRange&#8217; that takes one argument. The function should return &#8216;true&#8217; if the argument is higher than 50 and lower than 100. If the number is out of range, the function should return &#8216;false&#8217;. The return type should be boolean.</p>

<p>Use the argument 99 and answer with a call to the function.</p>







<h2>5. Iteration and loops</h2>
<p>For-loops and while-loops.</p>


<h3>Exercise 5.1</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that adds 4 to the number 90, 37 times. Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 5.2</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that subtracts 6 from 93, 20 times. Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 5.3</h3>
<p>Create a for-loop that counts the number of elements in the serie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6,8,95,2,12,152,4,78,621,45</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 5.4</h3>
<p>Create a for-loop that sums up the numbers in the serie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>67,2,12,28,128,15,90,4,579,450</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 5.5</h3>
<p>Create a for-loop that finds the largest number in the serie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6,8,95,2,12,152,4,78,621,45</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 5.6</h3>
<p>Create a for-loop that goes through the numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>67,2,12,28,128,15,90,4,579,450</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the current number is even, you should add it to a variable and if the current number is odd, you should subtract it from the variable.</p>

<p>Answer with the final result.</p>
